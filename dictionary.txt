Let's start with the Basic Smiley's:

:-) Your basic smilie. This smilie is used to inflect a sarcastic or joking statement
since we can't hear voice inflection via modem

More of a "don't hit me for what I just said" smilie.
:-( Frowning smilie. User did not like that last statement or is upset or depressed
about something.
:-I Indifferent smilie. Better than a Frowning smilie but not quite as good as a
happy smilie
